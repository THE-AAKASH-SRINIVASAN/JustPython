LIST

1//
Certain space separated numbers are passed as the input to the program. The program must print only the even numbers in the reverse order of their occurrence in the input sequence.

Example Input/Output:
Input:
10 99 23 12 78 81 102

Output:
102 78 12 10
//



numbers=list(map(int,input().split()))
for num in numbers[::-1]:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num,end=" ")


2//
Fill in the misssing lines of code so that the
program prints 100 300 500 as the output
//


numbers = [100,200,300,400,500]
x=3
y=1
del numbers[x]
del numbers[y]
for num in numbers:
    print (num,end=" ")


3//
len method can be used to find the length of a list or a tupule.

The below program prints 5 as the output as there are 5 elements in the tupule cities.
//
cities = ("Delhi","Mumbai","Chennai","Pune","Jaipur")
print (len(cities))


4//
Fill in the missing no of code? so and so
len comes as 10 as the length of the output. 
//

numbers = [100,200,300,400,500]
numbers=(100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900,1000)
print (len(numbers))


5//
Fill in the misssing lines of code so that the program 
prints the minimum value in the list marks.
//


Marks=[100,220,300,90,400]
print(min(Marks))



6//
Certain number of students appear for an exam and their marks are passed as the input to the program. 
The marks are separated by a space. The maximum marks that can be obtained in the exam is 100. 
Fill in the lines of code so that the program prints the total count of students who have scored 50 or 100
//


marks=list(map(int,input().split()))
print (marks.count(50) + marks.count(100))


7//
insert method can be used to insert an element (object) at a specific index.
The below program inserts 35 in between 30 and 50. 
Hence the output of the program is 10 20 30 35 50 90 100.
//


numbers = [10, 20, 30, 50, 90, 100]
numbers.insert(3,35)
for num in numbers:
    print (num, end=" ")


8//
Fill in the missing lines of code so that the output of the 
program is 100 200 400 500 600 900 1000
//



numbers = [100, 400, 900]

numbers.insert(1,200)
numbers.insert(3,500)
numbers.insert(4,600)
numbers
for num in numbers:
    print (num, end=" ")



9//
Fill in the missing lines of code to initialize a dictionary 
studentages so that the program prints 15 12 as the output.
//


studentages={"Leena":15,"Arun":12}
print (studentages["Leena", end=""])
print (studentages["Arun", end=""])


//
Fill in the missing lines of code so that the program prints 120 as the output.
//


marks={"Leena":45,"Arun":30}
marks[Arun]=75;
print (marks[Leena]+marks[Arun])



//
Fill in the missing lines of code so that the program prints the value for the single key in the
dictionary namelocation where the key name starts with K. 
Example Input/Output: 
Input: Arun Chennai Babu Trichy Karthik Tirunelveli Thaslim Salem Fathima Madurai 
Output: Tirunelveli
//


input_data = "Arun Chennai Babu Trichy Karthik Tirunelveli Thaslim Salem Fathima Madurai"
data_list = input_data.split(" ")
name_location = {data_list[i]: data_list[i+1] for i in range(0, len(data_list), 2)}
output = ""
for key in name_location:
    if key.startswith("K"):
      print(name_location[key]),end=" ")
