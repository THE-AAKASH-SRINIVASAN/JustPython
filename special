s = "loveleetcode"

for i, char in enumerate(s):
    print(f"Index: {i}, Character: {char}")


OUTPUT:
Index: 0, Character: l
Index: 1, Character: o
Index: 2, Character: v
Index: 3, Character: e
Index: 4, Character: l
Index: 5, Character: e
Index: 6, Character: e
Index: 7, Character: t
Index: 8, Character: c
Index: 9, Character: o
Index: 10, Character: d
Index: 11, Character: e

Why Use enumerate()?
✅ Tracks both index and value (no need for range(len(s))).
✅ More readable and Pythonic compared to manually managing indices.
✅ Efficient in loops when both index and value are needed.
